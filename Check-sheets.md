# Check Sheets

### Detailed Notes from the Video Lecture on Checks Sheets

1. **Definition of a Checks Sheet**:
   - A checks sheet is a structured form used for data collection and analysis.
   - It allows for systematic recording of data, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.

2. **Purpose of a Checks Sheet**:
   - To collect data consistently over time.
   - To track defects, issues, or specific events in a process.
   - To facilitate data analysis and decision-making.

3. **Steps to Create a Checks Sheet**:
   - **Identify the Situation**: Determine what you want to observe (e.g., defects in a manufacturing process).
   - **Document the Operational Definition**: Define what constitutes a defect and how it will be measured.
   - **Determine Who, When, and How Long**: Identify who will collect the data, the frequency of data collection, and the duration of the data collection period.
   - **Create the Checks Sheet**: Design the sheet to allow easy recording of data (e.g., using checkmarks).
   - **Pilot the Checks Sheet**: Test the sheet for usability and effectiveness, making adjustments as needed.
   - **Rollout the Checks Sheet**: Train users on how to use the sheet and implement it in the process.

4. **Example of a Checks Sheet**:
   - A checks sheet can be used to track different types of defects in a production line, where operators mark the type of defect each time it occurs.

### Real-Life Example: Quality Control in a Bakery

- **Context**: You work in a bakery that produces various types of bread and pastries. Quality control is essential to ensure that products meet customer expectations.
  
- **Using a Checks Sheet**:
  - **Data Collection**: You create a checks sheet to record defects such as "burnt edges," "uneven sizes," and "missing toppings" for each batch of products.
  - **Regular Use**: Each time a batch is produced, quality control staff fill out the checks sheet, noting any defects they observe.
  - **Analysis**: After a month, you analyze the data collected. You find that "burnt edges" occur more frequently during the afternoon shifts. This insight leads to investigating oven settings and staff training during those shifts.
  
- **Relevance**: This example illustrates how checks sheets can be effectively used in a real-world scenario to systematically collect and analyze data, leading to improvements in product quality.

### Potential White Belt Level Exam Questions

1. **What is a checks sheet, and what is its primary purpose?**
   - Answer should include the definition and purpose of checks sheets.

2. **List the six steps involved in creating a checks sheet.**
   - Answer should outline the steps: Identify the situation, document the operational definition, determine who/when/how long, create the checks sheet, pilot the checks sheet, and rollout the checks sheet.

3. **Explain how a checks sheet can help in identifying trends in a process.**
   - Answer should discuss the systematic data collection and how it allows for easy analysis of patterns.

4. **Provide an example of how data from a checks sheet can lead to process improvements.**
   - Answer should include a scenario similar to the bakery example provided.
